Using Fusion 360, we designed this elegant pink box to hold our PicoPro microcontroller and our IDD development HAT. The boards are screwed into the bottom of the box and openings allow for USB cables, speaker out, and various ribbon cables. The openings also allow for ventilation. An outer cover keeps the box closed (using a spring-loaded pushpin for quick access to the development board) without the need for a screwdriver, but secure enough so it doesn fall apart. The cover makes the enclosure more robust while also adding a sleek look.<br>

<b>Process and strategy to model the different parts and to fit them together:</b>

We begun our design process by deciding what we wanted our enclosure to be able to accomodate. We decided to make our case without a display, but able to fit a HAT and breadboard cables. Additionally, we wanted to have a design where the box could be opened with using a screwdriver. We initially decided to try to design a top and bottom that could snap together. Here are our initial sketches:

We measured out the dimensions of the Pico Pro and constructed a 3D model of the board (with enough detail for incoming wire connections, and to accomodate the dev HAT and breadboard wires) in Fusion 360 to use the top-down design methodology. From there we constructed the outer shell of the enclosure making sure to cut wide enough holes for the connectors. We then dimensioned the outer cover to fit around inner box giving it a 1 mm extra space to make sure that the inner enclosure would fit after printing.

We then performed our first iteration of printing and learned that our snap fit design was not suitable for 3D printing using the PLA plastic. material was not suitable for

Yes! The holes line up and there's enough room for the cables!<br>

Everything else looks like it printed without errors. <br>

The pieces go together - this 3D modeling stuff actually works! <br>

...and the USB cable fits just fine!
